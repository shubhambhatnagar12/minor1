                              Modified Shortest Path Algorithms for Multiple Dynamically Changing Scenarios

This is the minor project of Shubham Bhatnagar, Yashvardhan Singh Nathawat and Harsh Upparwal developed using C language.
In this project we're:
    -> Finding the shortest path of the entered graph 
    -> Travelling that shortest path
    -> Making Dynamic changes
         -> Adding Node
         -> Changing Weight
    -> Calculating time taken to calcule the path
