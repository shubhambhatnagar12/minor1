                              Modified Shortest Path Algorithms for Multiple Dynamically Changing Scenarios

This is the minor project of Shubham Bhatnagar, Yashvardhan Singh Nathawat and Harsh Upparwal developed using C language.

In this project we're:
    
		-> Finding the shortest path of the entered graph 
    
		-> Travelling that shortest path
    
		-> Making Dynamic changes
         		-> Adding Node
         		-> Changing Weight
    
		-> Calculating time taken to calcule the path

MAIN CODE IS IN Final-Minor-Code.c FILE
